# E-commerce Back End Starter Code

## Description

The backend for a simple e-commerce site where the business owner can post various products that have associated categories and product tags for searching. The back-end routes are fully set up with associations between models fully integrated. Testing can be done with an application like Insomnia without needing to set up a front-end, and the database can be fully read and modified using the routes as well. 


## Usage

Without a font end, simply source the database using mysql, seed the data with 'npm run seed', and finally start the server with 'npm start'. Make sure you've included your own personal user and password in a .env file and do npm i to ensure sequelize can sync to the database. Once you get the back-end up and running, you can test the routes in Insomnia or Postman.
